# Welcome to GitFS


gitfs is a [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) file system that fully
integrates with git. You can mount a remote repository's branch locally, and any
subsequent changes made to the files will be automatically committed to the
remote.

## What's its purpose?

gitfs was designed to bring the full powers of git to everyone, no matter how
little they know about versioning. A user can mount any repository and all the
his changes will be automatically converted into commits. gitfs will also expose
the history of the branch you're currently working on by simulating snapshots of
every commit.

gitfs is useful in places where you want to keep track of all your files, but at
the same time you don't have the possibility of organizing everything into
commits yourself. A FUSE filesystem for git repositories, with local cache

## Features
* Automatically commits changes: create, delete, update files and their metadata
* Browse through working index and commit history
* Merges with upstream by automatically accepting local changes
* Caching commits reduces the memory footprint and speeds up navigation
* Reduces the number of pushes by batching commits

## Development

You can find more documentation on [gitfs docs page](http://www.presslabs.com/gitfs/docs/).
