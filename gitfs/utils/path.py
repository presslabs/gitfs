def split_path_into_components(path):

    Splits a path and returns a list of its constituents.

    :param path: the path to be split
    :type path: str
    :returns: the list which contains the path components

    .. note::
        This function is by no means a function which treats all the possible
    constructs. Since we build the paths, we assume the following format. The
    path:
        * has to start with the `/` character if is not empty.
        * it cannot contain double slashes `//`
        * it cannot end with trailing slashes `/`

        Examples of correct paths:
           * ``
           * `/`
           * `/a/b`
